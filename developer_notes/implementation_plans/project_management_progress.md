  - Created `/packages/react-ui/src/ce/platform/projects/index.ts` - Export file for all project components

### Next Steps

#### Final Testing
- Backend API testing using `test-ce-projects-api.sh`
- Frontend component testing (form validation, navigation, etc.)
- End-to-end flow testing

### Completed Today (March 20, 2025)

#### Integration
- ✅ Added CE projects sidebar item to platform admin navigation
- ✅ Added CE project routes to main application router
- ✅ Fixed UI issue with duplicate headers by removing nested PlatformAdminContainer components

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Leverage Core Components**: 
   - Reusing the existing `Project` model from the shared codebase
   - Using existing project repositories for data access

2. **CE-Specific Implementation**: 
   - Following CE naming conventions (cm-prefix)
   - Creating CE-specific controllers and services
   - Creating CE-specific UI components

3. **Integration with Existing Platform Admin**: 
   - Adding routes to existing platform admin console
   - Following platform admin UI patterns for consistency

## Technical Decisions

- For project plans, analytics, and usage data, we're using simplified placeholder data in CE rather than complex EE logic
- Authorization is based on platform admin role checks
- API endpoints use the `/v1/ce/platform/projects` prefix to distinguish from EE endpoints

## Additional Notes

- The CE implementation provides similar functionality to EE but with simplified implementation
- No database schema changes were needed as we leverage existing project tables
- Frontend components will be implemented in a future work session
